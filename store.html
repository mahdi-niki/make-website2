          <h3>The Fox Wife</h3>
          <p>
            Some people think foxes are similar to ghosts because we go around
            collecting qi, or life force, but nothing could be further than the
            truth. We are living creatures, just like you, only usually better
            looking . . .

            A young woman is found frozen in the snow. Her death is clouded by
            rumors of foxes involved, which are believed to lure people by
            transforming themselves into beautiful women and men. Bao, a
            detective with a reputation for sniffing out the truth, is hired to
            uncover the dead woman’s identity. Since childhood, Bao has been
            intrigued by the fox gods, yet they’ve remained tantalizingly out of
            reach. Until, perhaps, now. Meanwhile, a family that owns a famous
            Chinese medicine shop can cure ailments, but not the curse that
            afflicts them―their eldest sons die before their twenty-fourth
            birthdays. Now the only grandson of the family is twenty-three. When
            a mysterious woman enters their household, their luck seems to
            change. Or does it? Is their new servant a simple young woman from
            the north or a fox spirit bent on her own revenge? New York Times
            bestselling author Yangsze Choo brilliantly explores a world of
            mortals and spirits, humans and beasts, and their dazzling
            intersection. The Fox Wife is a stunning novel about a winter full
            of mysterious deaths, a mother seeking revenge, and old folktales
            that may very well be true..

          <h3>The Fox Wife</h3>
          <p>
            Justin has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over
            the internet. Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate
            the second they break up...
          </p>
          <details class="dis_det1">
            <summary>more</summary>
            When a woman slides into his DMs with the
            same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and
            break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll
            both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and
            it just might work.
            Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse
            would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating
            Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when
            they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake
            Minnetonka. It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer.
